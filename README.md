## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="25"> Hi, I'm Ella

<strong>I'm a frontend engineer with a background in marketing, customer experience, and a deep interest in how people interact with technology.</strong><br/>

I specialize in building scalable, accessible, and intuitive web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern tooling. <br/>

Outside of code, I care about clarity whether through clean architecture or documentation. I enjoy breaking down complex systems into understandable pieces, and fostering strong collaboration through shared language and context.<br/>

I thrive at the intersection of user empathy and technical problem-solving and I’m always excited to build things that are both useful and delightful.<br/>
